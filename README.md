# Food-Delivery
This is an application for ordering food (*you cannot*). This is my first application using react router.

## Tech Stack

### **Client**
1. React
2. React Router
3. Tailwind 

### **Server**
1. Express


## Functionality 
    
1. Interact with 4 pages using routing.
2. About page with detailed info for every person (without routing)
3. Static contact page
4. Menu page with food
5. Sorting
6. Detailed page for every food (*with routing*)
7. The detailed page has a recommendation section that recommends 3 or less posts from the same category (*doesn't show the same post*) 

## How to run the project locally on your machine
1. **Download Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Run the Server**: Open integrated terminal in the server folder and type (*this is using nodemon*):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. **Run the Client**: Open integrated terminal in the client folder and type:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Notes 
- The templates are custom tailwind templates generated with AI
- The main point of this project is to practice the react router
